# LsaParser

A small lsass parser i wrote long time ago. not gonna continue working on it since i only wanted to learn the basics on how Lsass/Lsa works etc. was fun i guess.

# Credit
This project is shameless copied from another one but i can't seem to find it now (maybe they deleted it ?). 
Anyway imma update this readme once i found the original author. So i wont take credit besides that i rewrote it (and made it worse lol).
